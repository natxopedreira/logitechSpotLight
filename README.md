openFrameworks addon for logitech spotlight remote on linux

by defualt is recognized as a keyboard and if you press the first button it becomes an air mouse
but i want to use all the 3 keys so i made a class to interact with the device with hidapi

You can listen 3 buttons plus controll vibration for user feedback
